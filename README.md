# Ethical-hacking-Roadmap & bug hunting Roadmap
This is a resource factory for anyone looking forward to starting bug hunting and Ethical hacking would require guidance as a beginner. 

Hi! I'm Ashutosh chandra shah . I am currently working as a Security Engineer . I am creating this repository for everyone to contribute as to guide the young and enthusiastic minds for starting their career in bug bounties. More content will be added regularly. Keep following. So let's get started!

NOTE: The bug bounty landscape has changed since the last few years. The issues we used to find easily an year ago would not be easy now. Automation is being used rigorously and most of the "low hanging fruits" are being duplicated if you are out of luck. If you want to start doing bug bounty, you will have to be determined to be consistent and focused, as the competition is very high.

# Introduction
 What is a bug?
 
- Security bug or vulnerability is “a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, OR availability.

#What is Bug Bounty?

A bug bounty or bug bounty program is IT jargon for a reward or bounty program given for finding and reporting a bug in a particular software product. Many IT companies offer bug bounties to drive product improvement and get more interaction from end users or clients. Companies that operate bug bounty programs may get hundreds of bug reports, including security bugs and security vulnerabilities, and many who report those bugs stand to receive awards.

#What is the Reward?
There are all types of rewards based on the severity of the issue and the cost to fix. They may range from real money (most prevalent) to premium subscriptions (Prime/Netflix), discount coupons (for e commerce of shopping sites), gift vouchers, swags (apparels, badges, customized stationery, etc.). Money may range from 50$ to 50,000$ and even more.

Should align with the business objective of the organization


Sample Report


# Browser Extensions for Bug Bounty

 1) KNOXSS For Cross Site Scripting :
 
KNOXSS is a popular tool developed by Brazilian Security Researcher @Brutelogic . The tool aims to find Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability while we browse the website. If you are new to Cross Site Scripting attack We suggest you to check this post. The tool has two versions available, Community Edition which is free to use
 
 Link - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/knoxss-community-edition
 
 2) Wappalyzer :
 
 Wappalyzer is a technology profiler that identifies the CMS, JS libraries, Frameworks and other technologies that the websites use. It will help you to focus the recon process on a certain technology or framework by identifying them with the current version of them. The alternative for this add-on can be Builtwith technology Lookup
 
 Link - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wappalyzer
 
 3. Hackbar Addon

The security researchers will finds Hackbar tool to be extremely beneficial. When testing a web application or web server, we frequently alter the address bar’s settings. We repeatedly refresh webpages. All of these things frequently occur to us. Hackbar add-on aids us in reducing this time and performing our task quickly. The tool consist payloads for XSS attacks, SQL Injection, WAF Bypass Payloads, LFI Payloads etc.

Link: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/maxs-hackbar
Link: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hackbartool

4.FoxyProxy
A Firefox addon called FoxyProxy helps to automatically switch an internet connection between one or more proxy servers. FoxyProxy, to put it simply, simplifies the manual process of modifying the Connection Settings in Firefox. It is very useful during pen testing work. It helps in turning off/on proxy in a single click. FoxyProxy also does have feature of bypassing proxy (Intercept in burp suite) for specific domains using blacklist and whitelist feature.

Link: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard

5. DotGit
An extension for checking if .git is exposed in visited websites. The addon also checks for exposed environment files (.env), security.txt and more while we browse the web. This addon helps us in finding information disclosure vulnerability. Sometimes exposing environment file and git file can have serious security impact.

Link: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dotgit

6. User-Agent Switcher
A user-agent switcher modifies your browser’s user agent. When communicating with a web server, your browser sends a string of text or a HTTP header called a “user agent” that contains information about the user’s operating system, current browser, rendering engine, and other important components. Based on the users agent the servers gives response to the user.

During penetration testing we can test for application by loading same application in different types of browser such as for a Mobile, for a PC, for a tablet etc. This is very handy for developers as well for testing responsiveness of a developed website.

Link: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-string-switcher

7. ModHeader
ModHeader addon helps in modifying HTTP request and response headers easily in a browser. By the use of this add-on we can search for vulnerabilities like Authorization Bypass, cookie modification, session data manipulation, Referrer Bypass etc. Once we set HTTP header that will be used on each website that we visit.

Link: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/modheader-firefox/

8. Beautifier & Minify
You can easily minify and simplify CSS, HTML, and JavaScript code with the help of this add-on. During penetration testing we often land with large chunked JavaScript code which is difficult to read and get to understand the flow of code. In such time this addon help us in beautifully minifying code in readable format so that we can find flaws in source code.

Link: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/beautifer-minify/

9. Retire.js
With retire JS we can find for vulnerable JavaScript library. It helps in finding known vulnerabilities sin js and few of the CVE affecting JS products.

Link: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/retire-js/

10. Email Extractor
Automated email extraction tool that automatically saves email addresses from web pages that we visits. Main goal of this add-on is to collect possible exposed email address from source code and can aid in performing social engineering attacks, credential stuffing attack etc.

Link: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mailshunt-email-extractor/

11. TruffleHog Chrome Extension
The TruffleHog browser plugin scans visited websites for API keys and credentials and notifies you if any are found. This is helpful for conducting pentests and code reviews since it reveals keys that would otherwise be overlooked or need manual searching.

Link: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/trufflehog/bafhdnhjnlcdbjcdcnafhdcphhnfnhjc

12. Fake Filler
This extension’s goal is to make it easier and faster for developers and testers to test fill-up forms. It helps in filling all form inputs (textboxes, text areas, radio buttons, drop downs, etc.) with fake and randomly generated data.

Link: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fake-filler/

13. Click-jacking
This addon helps in finding clickjacking vulnerability by looking for absence of X-Frame-Options header in a website.

Link: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/click-jacking/

14. Cookie Editor
Cookie-Editor helps you in manipulating the cookie of a website. A user can modify, delete, add cookie values for different purpose of tests. Vulnerabilities like session theft, privilege escalation, session misconfiguration etc. can be tested using this add-on.

Some additional Tips

Don't do bug bounty as a full time in the beginning (although I suggest don't do it full time at any point). There is no guarantee to get bugs every other day, there is no stability. Always keep multiple sources of income (bug bounty not being the primary).
Stay updated, learning should never stop. Join twitter, follow good people, maintain the curiosity to learn something new every day. Read writeups, blogs and keep expanding your knowledge.

Always see bug bounty as a medium to enhance your skills. Money will come only after you have the skills. Take money as a motivation only.
Don't be dependent on automation. You can't expect a tool to generate money for you. Automation is everywhere. The key to success in Bug Bounty is to be unique. Build your own methodology, learn from others and apply on your own.

Always try to escalate the severity of the bug, Keep a broader mindset. An RCE always has higher impact than arbitrary file upload.
It's not necessary that a vulnerability will be rewarded based on the industry defined standard impact. The asset owners rate the issue with a risk rating, often calculated as impact * likelyhood (exploitability). For example, an SQL Injection by default has a Critical impact, but if the application is accessible only inside the organization VPN and doesn't contain any user data/PII in the database, the likelyhood of the exploitation is reduced, so does the risk.

Stay connected to the community. Learn and contribute. There is always someone better than you in something. don't miss an opportunity to network. Join forums, go to conferences and hacking events, meet people, learn from their experiences.

Always be helpful.
